Web-scraping careerjet job openings to analyse the labour market

During my work as an Economist I worked with a lot of official data which often lags behind, gets revised and sometimes is even plain wrong. 

I believe to provide the best insight for policy making, we need to have access to the most up to date, relevant information and therefore I wanted to start the project of collecting updated labour market data. Currently the Maltese labour market is characterised by high demand for high skilled labour, specifically in the gaming and financial services sector. I wanted to look into this further. I wanted to analyse which industries have the highest job openings and at what rate these vacancies are being filled. 

The first instinct was to go with Linkedin data. However after hearing about an ongoing lawsuit against web scrapers and several user agreements I decided to better stay away from that for good. Either way it only included limited job listings (for the Maltese market) at the time of writing. I decided to opt for a perhaps lesser known globally but more used locally site careerjet - https://www.careerjet.com.mt. It had more job openings listed and there were no major warnings against scraping the data.
